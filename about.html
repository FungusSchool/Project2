          Coca ‑ Cola has a long history and has been a popular drink among
          people around the world since it was created in 1886 by the pharmacist
          Dr. John Pemberton in Atlanta, USA. Since then, the drink has been
          sold as a thirst quencher for everyone and 98 percent of the world's
          population knows the brand. Coca ‑ Cola is today found in more than
          200 countries and was launched in Sweden in 1953.

        <div class="lightT drinksT">
          Coca ‑ Cola light was launched in Sweden in 1983 and then became the
          first Coca ‑ Cola variant since 1886. Coca ‑ Cola light is a
          sugar-free and calorie-free soft drink. The product is developed to
          suit those who like a really good drink but who want it without added
          sugar. To clarify the lighter cola taste, Coca ‑ Cola light from the
          autumn of 2018 is called Coca ‑ Cola light taste.

        <div class="zeroT drinksT">
          Coca-Cola Zero was introduced around the world in 2006 and quickly
          became the largest sugar-free beverage on the market. In April 2007,
          Coca ‑ Cola zero sugar was launched with a new recipe to be as similar
          to Coca ‑ Cola Original Taste as possible. The idea is to offer
          consumers the opportunity to choose Coca-Cola, with or without sugar.

        <div class="energyT drinksT">
          In 2019, Coca ‑ Cola Energy was launched - an energy drink with a
          taste of Coca ‑ Cola. The drink contains caffeine from natural
          sources, guarana extract and vitamin B and is free of taurine. The
          product comes in two variants, one with sugar and one sugar-free.

        <h1>The dice game</h1>
        <h4 class="diceInfoT">
          The dice game has three buttons. Roll high, roll low, buy coke. When
          you roll high you bet all you money and is hopping for high numbers.
          If it lands above 7 you double the amount you had. 7 and your money
          stays the same but below 7 you lose half. Roll low works the same but
          you fliped so you want below 7. Every time you bet you also spend 10
          energy you cant play if you run out of energy. To get more you can
          spend 200$ with the buy coke button with gives you 100 energy. So if
          you run out of energy and have less then 200 bucks you can't play
          anymore.
